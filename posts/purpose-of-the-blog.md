**Why I have started the blog?**

There are several reasons for that.

First. I want to keep track of my progress towards learning Rust and contributing to it. Writing short posts will help me remember what I have learned as well as it should force me to be consistent with research. The commitment to publish a summary at least once a week will push me to make measurable progress. 
I assume it might not work as I expect, but it is not a big deal. Nothing works perfectly on the first try.

Second. I do not feel comfortable writing in English. It takes a huge amount of time. Regular practice, I hope, will reduce mental work that is required for expressing my thoughts.

The last reason is self-advertising. I see it as a good addition to my resume.
