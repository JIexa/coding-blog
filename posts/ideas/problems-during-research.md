## What problmes I face while doing research?

- Procrastination
	- praparing the environment for productive work
	...blog, problems.
	...how do I deal with it?

- Preparing to start
	- where does it come from?
	- desc:
	... do stuff that is easy to accomplish (creating something new: anki decks, adding unpublished posts,...)

- Comparing myself with others.
Rust is devedloped by extremely smart people. No doubts. This fact occasionally hurts me when I struggle to understand some complicated concepts and do not know where I am going. At these moments, I am dicouraged and demotivated. It is hard. I regularly find myself comparing their achievements with mine. 
But at such moments I keep reminding myself:
1. Where is no way back. I tried 3 different options as my research. It is not a matter of topic. I have to come over something that I don't realize. I just need exploring what I have started.
2. I will learn a lot along the way. Rust is an extremely complicated language with tools like borrowing, lifetimes, the query system, etc. Knowing how it works and what problems are solved with different apporoaches will help me become a better programmer. 

I haven't made contributions to any open source projects before. It is scary.
I even strugging with writing posts in Reddit. There is a block. I don't fully understand where does it come from. It just occurs.
